Patient: My left eye is blurry, and I can't see in the central part of my vision, and there's some distortion.

Doctor: Do you have any history of allergies?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Besides the eye issues, are there any other discomforts?
Patient: Recently, I've also had some headaches.

Patient: Can this be cured?
Doctor: It should be possible to improve and control, but further examination is needed to confirm.
Patient: Should I go to the hospital for a check-up right away?
Doctor: Yes, I recommend you go to the ophthalmology department as soon as possible. You may need intravitreal injections.

Doctor: Yes, you can. Follow the medication instructions I gave you and make sure to get an appointment for a check-up as soon as possible.
Patient: What might be the cause of this condition?
Doctor: It could be a problem with the retinal blood vessels. The exact cause needs to be determined by further hospital examinations.
