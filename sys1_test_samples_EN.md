**Doctor:**  Hello, I'm your online doctor. How can I assist you today?

**Patient:** Hello, doctor. I've been experiencing frequent urination for many years. I'm a woman, and I urinate more than ten times a day (once at night). Each time I urinate, it takes me several minutes to finish. It's like I urinate a bit, stop, then urinate a bit more before I'm finally done. This has been going on for over four years. Additionally, when I squat, it feels like a small tongue is hanging out of my vaginal opening.

**Doctor:**  Hello, based on your symptoms of frequent urination, difficulty in urination, and the sensation of something like a small tongue hanging out of your vaginal opening, these could be related to various conditions such as overactive bladder, urinary tract infection, or urethral syndrome. I recommend further examinations to determine the specific cause. Given your symptom description, you might have overactive bladder, urinary tract infection, or urethral syndrome. I suggest urine analysis, urine culture, blood tests, ultrasound examinations, and cystoscopy to identify the exact cause. If diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, antibiotics may be prescribed. If overactive bladder is confirmed, medication and behavioral interventions might be necessary. If urethral syndrome is diagnosed, treatment will be targeted at the specific cause. I advise you to seek medical attention as soon as possible for an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

**Predicted Questions:**

- Besides frequent urination and incomplete bladder emptying, are there any other symptoms I should be aware of, such as back pain or abnormal discharge?
- What examinations will the doctor use to determine the specific cause of my condition?
- What causes the phenomenon of a small tongue hanging out of the vaginal opening, and how might it affect my health?

**Patient:** I've had a routine urine test, and it's normal. I haven't had any other tests. I've had one vaginal delivery and wonder if that's related to my frequent urination and the sensation in my vaginal opening.

**Doctor:** Vaginal delivery can have an impact on the pelvic floor muscles, potentially causing frequent urination and abnormal sensations in the vaginal area. However, to confirm the diagnosis, additional examinations are necessary. Based on your current symptoms and test results, you might have overactive bladder. I recommend urine culture, blood tests, ultrasound examinations, and cystoscopy to determine the exact cause. If overactive bladder is confirmed, medication and behavioral interventions might be needed.

**Patient:** What is overactive bladder, and how is it treated if needed?


**Doctor:** Overactive Bladder (OAB) is a common urinary system condition characterized by symptoms such as frequent urination, urgency, nocturia, and urge urinary incontinence. Treatment methods for OAB include lifestyle changes, bladder training, physical therapy, and medication. Lifestyle changes involve reducing the intake of caffeine and alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and scheduled voiding. Bladder training can help improve bladder control. Physical therapy, such as pelvic floor muscle training, can strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Medications mainly include M-cholinergic receptor antagonists and β3 adrenergic agonists. Based on your symptom description, you might have overactive bladder. I suggest you first try lifestyle changes and bladder training. If these methods are not effective, you can consider medication such as M-cholinergic receptor antagonists or β3 adrenergic agonists. If symptoms persist or worsen, consult a urologist for further evaluation and treatment.

**Patient:**  So, what should I do?

**Doctor:**  I suggest you first try lifestyle changes and bladder training. If these methods are not effective, you can consider medication such as M-cholinergic receptor antagonists or β3 adrenergic agonists. If symptoms persist or worsen, I recommend consulting a urologist for further evaluation and treatment.

**Predicted Questions:**

- Doctor, what specific tests do I need to confirm the cause of my condition?
- Doctor, what is the specific impact of vaginal delivery on pelvic floor muscles, and how can I perform pelvic floor muscle training?

---

**Patient:**  Doctor, how can I improve my symptoms through lifestyle changes?

**Doctor:**  Lifestyle changes are an essential step in improving the symptoms of overactive bladder. You can try the following measures: 1. Fluid management: It is recommended to limit daily fluid intake to no more than 2.5 liters and avoid drinking at night, especially avoiding beverages that may irritate the bladder, such as coffee, tea, and alcohol. 2. Weight reduction: If you are overweight, losing weight may help improve urinary incontinence symptoms. 3. Medication review: If you are taking medications that may affect bladder function, such as diuretics and α-adrenergic receptor antagonists, consult your doctor about discontinuing or changing medications. 4. Pelvic floor muscle training: If you also have stress urinary incontinence, pelvic floor muscle training can help improve pelvic floor function and increase urethral stability. 5. Use of pads and tampons: To cope with potential leaks during activity, you can use pads and tampons to stay dry and clean. Based on your symptom description, you might have overactive bladder (OAB). I suggest you first try the lifestyle changes and bladder training mentioned above. If these methods are not effective, you can consider medication such as M-cholinergic receptor antagonists or β3 adrenergic agonists. If symptoms persist or worsen, I recommend consulting a urologist for further evaluation and treatment.

**Predicted Questions:**

- Doctor, besides frequent urination and urgency, what other common symptoms does overactive bladder have?
- Doctor, if I start using medication for overactive bladder, are there any side effects or contraindications I should be aware of?
- Doctor, besides lifestyle changes and medication, what other physical therapy methods can help improve the symptoms of overactive bladder?


**Patient choose:** Doctor, besides lifestyle changes and medication, what other physical therapy methods can help improve the symptoms of overactive bladder?

**Doctor:** In addition to lifestyle changes and medication, physical therapy is also an effective method to improve the symptoms of overactive bladder. Bladder training can help you relearn the skills to control urination, extend the interval between urination, and increase bladder capacity. Pelvic floor muscle training can strengthen the pelvic floor muscles and improve urinary incontinence symptoms. Additionally, transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation therapy and biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor muscle training are also available physical therapy methods that can help patients who do not respond well to traditional treatments.

**Doctor:** Hello, I am your online doctor. How can I assist you today?

**Patient:** My neck is red and swollen with pain this morning, seemingly from an insect bite. I'm located in Hainan. Upon waking up, I noticed the area below my ears and on my neck is a bit red, about the size of a palm, with a sensation of pain when touched. There are also patches of redness between my collarbones that look like eczema after scratching. What could this be?

**Doctor:** Based on your description, this could be atopic dermatitis (eczema) or scabies infection. Atopic dermatitis usually presents with red, swollen, and itchy skin, sometimes with oozing and crusting. Scabies infection, caused by mites, is characterized by intense itching, often worsening at night, with possible burrows on the skin. Given that you live in Hainan, with its warm and humid climate, you might indeed be more susceptible to insect bites. Further observation or examination is needed to determine the exact cause. Currently, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis and require more information or test results. I suggest you monitor any changes in your symptoms; if they persist or worsen, or if new symptoms appear, you should seek medical attention promptly. During your visit, the doctor may conduct a skin examination or recommend other tests to identify the cause.

To better diagnose your condition, I need to know if you have a history of similar issues, such as allergies or skin diseases. Additionally, if you can provide more details about your symptoms, such as when they first appeared and if there are any specific triggers, it would aid in the diagnosis.

**Predicted Questions:**
- Besides the redness and pain on my neck, I also have a fever and headache. Is this related to the insect bite?
- Could the redness and pain on my neck spread to other areas, and what long-term effects could it have on my body?
- I'm in Hainan; could the climate and environment here make me more prone to insect bites, leading to these symptoms?

---


**Patient:** I don't have any other symptoms, nor do I have a history of similar conditions or allergies.

**Doctor:** Knowing that you have no other symptoms and no relevant medical or allergy history helps narrow down the possible causes. Based on your current description, here are some considerations and suggestions:

1. **Insect Bite Reaction:** Given your location in Hainan with its hot and humid climate, insect bites are a common possibility.
2. **Contact Dermatitis:** If you have recently come into contact with new substances, such as plants or chemicals, it could lead to contact dermatitis,表现为 skin redness and itching.
3. **Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema):** Although you have no history of it, atopic dermatitis can sometimes flare up suddenly, especially in hot and humid climates.
4. **Scabies:** While scabies usually presents with more extensive rashes and intense nighttime itching, it cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if people you've been in close contact with have similar symptoms.

**Suggestions:**
- **Monitor Symptom Changes:** Continue to observe if there are any changes in the red and itchy areas, such as expansion or worsening of symptoms.
- **Avoid Scratching:** Try to minimize scratching to prevent exacerbating skin damage or causing infections.
- **Local Care:** You can use a mild moisturizer to alleviate dry skin and itching, avoiding strong soaps or bathing products.
- **Seek Medical Examination:** If symptoms persist or worsen, it is advised to seek medical attention as soon as possible. The doctor may conduct a skin examination and possibly perform skin scrapings or blood tests to confirm the diagnosis.

When seeking medical attention, remember to describe your symptoms and any recent changes in your living environment in detail, which can help the doctor make a more accurate diagnosis.

I hope these suggestions are helpful. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. Wishing you a speedy recovery!

**Patient:** Doctor, is it scabies infection, and what medication do I need?

**Doctor:** Based on your symptoms, scabies infection is a possibility, but further confirmation is needed. Scabies infection usually comes with intense nighttime itching, and the skin may exhibit tiny burrows. If diagnosed with scabies, common medications include 5% permethrin cream (Permethrin) and 10%-25% sulfur ointment. These medications should be used under a doctor's guidance, typically applied to the entire body and left on for a certain period without washing off. It is recommended that you seek medical attention promptly for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate medication. Based on your current symptom description, it is advised to undergo skin scraping or culture tests to determine whether it is a scabies infection or another skin issue. If diagnosed with scabies, the doctor will prescribe corresponding medications, such as permethrin cream or sulfur ointment. Meanwhile, pay attention to local care, avoid scratching, and use antihistamines and corticosteroid creams to relieve itching and swelling.

**Patient:** I bought calamine lotion yesterday and applied it three times. It caused a burning sensation, and after cleaning it just now, I found that my skin feels a bit ulcerated.

**Doctor:** Calamine lotion is usually used to treat mild skin inflammation and itching, but if it causes a burning sensation and skin ulceration after application, it may be due to an allergic reaction to the lotion's ingredients or other skin issues. It is recommended to stop using calamine lotion immediately and seek medical attention as soon as possible. The doctor may suggest a skin examination to determine the cause of the skin ulceration and provide appropriate treatment suggestions. Based on the patient's symptom description, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made at present. It is advised that the patient seeks medical attention promptly for a skin examination and other related tests to determine the cause. During the visit, the doctor may prescribe medications such as antihistamines, corticosteroid creams, etc., to alleviate symptoms. In addition, the doctor may also recommend allergy testing to determine if there is an allergic reaction.

The patient is asked to provide more information, such as the specific manifestations of the symptoms, duration, whether there are specific triggers, whether there is a history of allergies, etc. In addition, it is recommended that the patient undergo a skin examination and other related tests to help the doctor make an accurate diagnosis.
